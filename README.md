# IPHelper
GUI Script for remote users to provide IP information over the phone

# Purpose
Ever have a remote user that needs assistance and you have to walk them through getting their IP address for you?
Sometimes....this can be a painful process, especially for those users whom are less than tech saavy. 

This utility presents a form with a single "Capture Data" button,that when clicked, gathers the IP information of the wired and wireless connections on a user's computer. 

I've provided the ps1 file for now, if you'd like to wrap it in an exe, there are plenty of processes out there that can do it. 
I do plan on providing an executable, and hopefully an installer at some point.
